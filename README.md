# Loan-Prediction
As part of my "Supervised Learning" class, I worked on the Loan_data_set from kaggle to help determine if a customer is eligible for a loan or not.

# Data-Analysis
In the data analysis phase of the project, we examined both categorical and numerical features, investigating their distributions and exploring the relationships between them.

# Data-Preprocessing
During the preprocessing stage, we eliminated unecessary features, addressed missing values by employing "mode" for categorical features and "mean" for numerical ones.
Subsequently, we eliminated outliers, encoded categorical variables, and, when deemed beneficial for improved distribution, applied square transformations.

# Modeling
As a concluding step, we evaluated various classification models and contrasted their outcomes.

# Models used in this project
Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN)

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Voting Classifier

# Conclusion
While all models have the potential to reach up to 70% accuracy, the Random Forest model outperformed the others, achieving a remarkable accuracy of 93%.
